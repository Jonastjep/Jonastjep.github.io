	<div class="time-line">
		<ul>
			<li><b>1452: Leonardo born on April 15, in Vinci. </b> Leonardo was born to Ser Piero, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant girl; his parents were never married.</li>
			<li><b>1467: Leonardo becomes an apprentice to Andrea del Verrocchio, in Florence.</b> This date is an estimate, the apprenticeship could have begun a year or two later. But even 1467 would have been a bit late according to the customs of the time: Leonardo would have been fifteen, and most apprentices began at a younger age.</li>
			<li><b>1473: Leonardo draws a landscape on the Feast of Santa Maria delle Neve.</b> This is his earliest known drawing, though he probably also had a hand in Verrochio's <em>Baptism of Christ</em>, which probably reached completion in or around 1473.</li>
			<li><b>1481: Leonardo receives a commission to paint the <em>Adoration of the Magi</em>.</b> The painting was never completed, yet was–and is–considered a masterpiece. This same year, most of the other noteworthy painters in Florence were sent to Rome to work on projects for the Pope. </li>
			<li><b>1482: Leonardo moves from Florence to Milan, entering the patronage of Ludovico Sforza.</b> By this time, Leonardo is writing in his notebooks regularly.</li>
			<li><b>1483: Leonardo receives a commission to paint the <em>Virgin of the Rocks</em>.</b> Also, Raphael is born in 1483.</li>
			<li><b>1489: Leonardo studies anatomy.</b></li>
			<li><b>1490: Leonardo begins work in earnest on the bronze horse for his patron Ludovico Sforza. Leonardo begins a book on landscape and hydraulic works; it is never finished. Salai enters his household at the age of 10.</b></li>
			<li><b>1495: Leonardo begins his <em>Last Supper</em> in the convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie.</b></li>
			<li><b>1496: Leonardo illustrates mathematician Fra Luca Pacioli's <em>De divina proportione</em>. </b></li>
			<li><b>1498: · Leonardo decorates the walls and ceiling of the Sala delle Asse. He also made his first attempts at planning a flying machine around this time.</b></li>
			<li><b>1499: The French army conquers Milan; Leonardo leaves.</b></li>
			<li><b>1500: Leonardo and Pacioli go to Mantua, then Leonardo continues on to Florence.</b> In Mantua, he draws the <em>Portrait in Profile of Isabelle d'Este</em>. In Florence, he paints the <em>Virgin and Child with Saint Anne</em>.</li>
			<li><b>1502: Leonardo becomes Cesare Borgia's military engineer.</b> Leonardo travels around the Romagna, inspecting fortifications. He meets Machiavelli. </li>
			<li><b>1503: Back in Florence, Leonardo begins the <em>Battle of Anghiari</em>.</b>Also, in 1503 Florence tries to divert the Arno River away from Pisa in order to defeat Pisa in war. Leonardo and Machiavelli may have cooperated on this project. </li>			
			<li><b>1505: Leonardo makes a second attempt to build a flying machine and begins sketches for the Mona Lisa, which he completes sometime later.</b>In 1505, Leonardo gives up on the <em>Battle of Anghiari</em>, which is deteriorating as he works on it.</li>
			<li><b>1507: Leonardo is appointed Louis XII's painter and engineer.</b> He paints a second version of the <em>Virgin of the Rocks</em>. He meets his beautiful young assistant, Francesco Melzi. Also, he travels to Florence in a lawsuit against his brothers of his inheritance from his uncle Francesco. </li>	
			<li><b> 1508: Michelangelo begins work on the Sistine Chapel frescoes. </b></li>
			<li><b>1513: Leonardo moves to Rome. Living in the Vatican, he studies the properties of mirrors.</b> It is perhaps at this time that he paints the Turin Self-portrait. It was in this year that Leo X (Medici) became pope; the previous year the Medici family returned to power in Florence.</li>
			<li><b>1515: Around this time, Leonardo paints the painting <em>John the Baptist</em>.</b> He also constructs a mechanical lion for the coronation of the new king of France, Francis I. </li>
			<li><b>1516: Leonardo permanently leaves Italy for France, where he will serve Francis I in his court in Amboise.</b></li>
